\usage{
pangenome(
  gsParam,
  genomeIDs = NULL,
  refGenome = NULL,
  propAssignThresh = 0.25,
  maxNonSynPlaces = 4,
  verbose = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gsParam}{A list of genespace parameters created by init_genespace.}

\item{genomeIDs}{character vector, specifying which genomes to use. Defaults
to all genomeIDs specification in gsParam.}

\item{refGenome}{character string matching one of the genomeIDs in gsParam}

\item{propAssignThresh}{numeric of length 1, the minimum proportion of genes
in a pangenome entry needed to anchor the physical position to a new location}

\item{verbose}{logical, should updates be printed to the console?}
}
\value{
a data.table with lists of gene ids for each genome. Each row
corresponds to a unique combination of orthogroup and physical position
on the reference. Where multiple positions are inferred on a single
chromosome, the positions are broken out by the column 'clus'.
}
\description{
\code{pangenome} Convert orthogroup and synteny information into a
pangenome database. Predict locations of orthogroups that are missing a
node in the reference.
}
\details{
The pangenome annotation is a projection of syntenic orthogroups
on the physical coordinate system of a reference genome. The pangenome
function runs the following pipeline.
\enumerate{
\item within-block orthogroups and synteny-constrained global orthogroups
are merged.
\item the reference position is projected for all genes within syntenic
block bounds.
\item physical projected positions for each syntenic orthgroup is clustered,
permitting multiple reference locations (e.g. in a polyploid)
\item orthogroups with placements on the reference are populated and un-
placed orthgroups are added within reference position information
\item array members are added to the orthogroups
\item non-syntenic orthologs are added and flagged
